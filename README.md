# Onenob-Mix-Plugins

The Onenob series of plugins is a unique collection of 10 audio processing tools 
that aim to provide a simple and easy-to-use experience for users. These plugins
are available in both mono and stereo versions, making them versatile and suitable
for a wide range of audio projects. While many plugins offer multiple controls for 
different parameters, the Onenob series stands out by using only one knob for each
plugin, allowing users to achieve quick and intuitive results.

The aim of this project is to explore the various opcodes in Csound and gui capabilities 
of Cabbage to create visually appealing and user-friendly plugins that can be easily integrated 
into a digital audio workstation (DAW) workflow. Inspired by Waves OneKnob series plugins, 
One of the main aspect of these plugins is that they have a single knob to control the effect, 
making them beginner-friendly.

The 10 plugins in the Onenob series are:

 Onenob Sparkle
 Onenob Deep Bass
 Onenob Mid
 Onenob HFilter
 Onenob LFilter
 Onenob Compress
 Onenob Delay
 Onenob Ambient
 Onenob Distort
 Onenob Weirdo\newline


Each plugin offers a unique audio processing effect, including parametric equalization,
high-pass and low-pass filters, compression, delay, reverb, distortion, and more. 
The simplicity of the Onenob series allows users to easily add depth, dimension, 
and character to their audio projects with just a twist of a knob. Although currently 
only available as Audio Units (AU) plugins for use in Apple Logic Pro X, these plugins 
can be conveniently exported as Virtual Studio Technology (VST) plugins to operate seamlessly 
on both Mac and Windows systems, providing maximum flexibility and compatibility to all audio producers and engineers.

I hope you enjoy them!
